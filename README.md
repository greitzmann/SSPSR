### Learning Spatial-Spectral Prior for Super-Resolution of Hyperspectral Imagery

In this paper, we introduce a spatial-spectral prior network (SSPN) to fully exploit the spatial information and the correlation between the spectra of the hyperspectral data. Considering that the hyperspectral training samples are scarce and the spectral dimension of hyperspectral image data is very high, it is nontrivial to train a stable and effective deep network. Therefore, a group convolution (with shared network parameters) and progressive upsampling framework is proposed. This will not only alleviate the difficulty in feature extraction due to high dimension of the hyperspectral data, but also make the training process more stable. To exploit the spatial and spectral prior, we design a spatial-spectral block (SSB), which consists of a spatial residual module and a spectral attention residual module.
